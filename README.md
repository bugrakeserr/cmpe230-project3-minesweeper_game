The objective of this project is to develop a Minesweeper game using C++ and the Qt framework. 
This involves creating a graphical user interface, implementing mine placement and detection logic, and handling user interactions. 
The goal is to deliver a polished and enjoyable Minesweeper game that highlights the capabilities of Qt and C++.

Minesweeper is a solo logic-based computer game played on a rectangular grid. 
The goal is to uncover a set number of hidden "mines" by clicking on "safe" squares while avoiding those with mines. 
If a mine is clicked, the game ends. Otherwise, a number from 0 to 8 appears, indicating the count of mines in the eight adjacent squares.
For instance, finding an "8" means all eight neighboring squares have mines, while a "0" (shown as a blank) means no mines are nearby.
Players can mark suspected mine squares with a flag.

Qt is a powerful cross-platform application development framework widely used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and cross-platform applications.
Written in C++, Qt allows developers to build applications that can run on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android without modifying the source code. 
It provides a comprehensive set of libraries and tools, including support for widgets, signals and slots for event handling, and an integrated development environment (Qt Creator). 
Qt's flexibility and extensive features make it a popular choice for both open-source and commercial software development.
